## Introduction

Moonlark is an open, stable, non-profit, multifunctional chatbot.

Moonlark is the next project from the Moonlark Project, written using the Nonebot2 framework based on Python3.

## Background

If you did not hear Moonlark, you may have heard another name, XDbot.

To address the problem of the XDbot2 code being too confused and incompatible, we decided to develop a new project named Moonlark.

## Usage

Moonlark is currently in beta.
